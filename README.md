# Dropbox

Send file uploads in Roam directly to your Dropbox!

## Usage

First, navigate to the Roam Depot Settings to log into Roam with your Dropbox account. Once you grant RoamJS access to upload files for you, your credentials will be stored in your browser.

Anytime you upload a file to Roam, the dropbox extension will intercept the upload and send it to your dropbox account instead!
